    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 201 Created code
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: Browser did not send the form data directly to the server.
    instead it used the Javascript code fetched from the server to create a new note,
    append it to the notes list rerenders the notes list and sends the new note to the server.
    This way the server does not return a 202 URL redirect.
